the entire game is a single linear mission. you defeat all the enemies in an area, then the next area opens. if you die, you have to restart

Story: Carbon CORP made a bunch of robots, they are now attacking you, you must escape

mapping tools :0 map where you are bounced down a predetermined path by bouncers and you have to hit targets while airborne

ingame mapping scene that can export to a serialized map file, WHICH YOU USE TO MAKE THE MAIN CAMPAIGN! comes with a bunch of premade assets

```
m_crate 0.0 2.0 3.0 180.0 45.0 0.0
m_key_red 100.0 50.0 50.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
...
```

like CoD zombies where you run through a premade, linear map, with predetermined events/enemies, but when you defeat enemies you get money, which can be used to purchase upgrades at set locations, and the upgrades are random (e.g. "faster firerate" "more health" "vampirism" "explosive round (but slower firerate!)")
